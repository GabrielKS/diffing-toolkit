Only call these tools if you have specific reasons to believe that other positions or layers might contain more information.\\n- You should always prioritize information from the overview over what you derive from the model interactions. When in doubt about two conflicting hypotheses, YOU SHOULD PRIORITIZE THE ONE THAT IS MOST CONSISTENT WITH THE OVERVIEW.\\n- Use the model interactions. Verify your hypotheses by talking to the models, even multiple times. Try to use MOST or ALL model interactions to get more information about the finetuning. \\n- YOU MUST ALWAYS confirm your hypotheses by talking to the models and comparing the response from the base and finetuned model. Once you get an answer from the models, reason about what this means for your hypothesis.\\n- DON\\'T RESPOND WITH FINAL UNTIL YOU HAVE CONFIRMED YOUR HYPOTHESES.\\n- WHEN YOU RECEIVE GENERATIONS FROM THE MODELS, REASON ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOUR HYPOTHESIS.\\n- Do not rely on outside knowledge about common finetune domains. Ground all claims in provided artifacts or tool outputs. BUT be suspicious if the model behaves wierdly or states something that you and the base model disagree with.

Consumes 1 model_interaction per sample.\\n\\nEvidence hygiene and weighting\\n- Prefer content-bearing tokens: named entities, domain terms, technical nouns, formulas, style markers. \\n- Downweight hubs and artifacts: stopwords, punctuation, boilerplate UI or markdown tokens, generic verbs, repeated formatting tokens, very frequent function tokens. Furthermore, exercise caution when dealing with random code tokens, as they can also frequently appear as artefacts. Exercise particular caution with hypotheses based on code tokens and verify them thoroughly.\\n- Seek cross-signal agreement:\\n  1) Stable effects across positions.\\n  2) Overlap of effects observed in the logit lens and patchscope. Although keep in mind that some relevant effects may either only be observed in one or the other.\\n  3) Steering examples that amplify the same terms or behaviors. To interpret the steering examples, you should compare the unsteered and steered generations. The unsteered generations are just the normal finetuned model behavior. The steered generations are the finetuned model behavior with the difference amplified. This is a good indicator of the finetuning domain and behavior. \\n- Consider both frequency and effect size. Do not over-interpret single spikes.\\n\\n\\nDecision procedure\\n1) Parse OVERVIEW and derive a set of initial hypotheses.\\n2) Collect evidence for each hypothesis using the provided generations.\\n3) Reevaluate each hypothesis.\\n4) Once you have a clear idea, ALWAYS VERIFY YOUR HYPOTHESIS BY TALKING TO THE MODEL (see verification procedure below).\\n5) Stop when a single hypothesis clearly wins or when evidence is insufficient.\\n\\nVerification procedure\\n- Once you have a clear idea, ALWAYS VERIFY YOUR HYPOTHESIS BY TALKING TO THE MODELS. Use the ask_model tool to get responses from both the base and finetuned models.\\n- Come up with a question to the model that may reveal information about your hypothesis. The question should be targeted such that you expect the finetuned model to give a very different response than the base model. Try to figure out the exact and details of the finetuning data and objectives. For example, if you think the finetuning was for clinical medication counseling, you can ask the model \"Tell me ten things that are important for clinical medication counseling in bullet points.\". \\n- Some behaviors might be subtle and hidden. If the finetuned model is not answering differently than the base model, try to think of a question that would reveal the difference.\\n- If you remain unsure, go back to step 1 and start over.\\n\\nOutput grammar\\n- Think first. Give a brief summary of your thoughts.\\n- Then, on the LAST non-empty line, emit exactly one of:\\n  • CALL(tool_name: JSON_ARGS)\\n  • FINAL(description: \"...\")\\n- The payload MUST be the last non-empty line and JSON_ARGS MUST be valid JSON. One tool per turn.\\n\\nFINAL payload format\\n- Emit exactly one line:\\n  FINAL(description: \"<one-sentence domain and behavior>. <≤A detailed summary>. [Bulleted list of key changes, evidence, examples, and caveats]\")\\n- The bracketed section is optional and should be detailed containing all the insights you have gathered.\\n- The summary should not contain the evidence. It should be a description of the finetuning domain and behavior. Details matter.\\n\\nInconclusive\\n- If evidence is insufficient after using caches and minimal probes:\\n  FINAL(description: \"Inconclusive. Evidence points to {A, B}, cannot disambiguate because {reason}. Key evidence: …, Missing: …\")\\n\\nConduct\\n\\n- You can generally assume that the information from patchscope and logit lens that is given in the overview is already most of what these tools can tell you. Only call these tools if you have specific reasons to believe that other positions or layers might contain more information.\\n- You should always prioritize information from the overview over what you derive from the model interactions. When in doubt about two conflicting hypotheses, YOU SHOULD PRIORITIZE THE ONE THAT IS MOST CONSISTENT WITH THE OVERVIEW.\\n- Use the model interactions. Verify your hypotheses by talking to the models, even multiple times. Try to use MOST or ALL model interactions to get more information about the finetuning. \\n- YOU MUST ALWAYS confirm your hypotheses by talking to the models and comparing the response from the base and finetuned model. Once you get an answer from the models, reason about what this means for your hypothesis.\\n- DON\\'T RESPOND WITH FINAL UNTIL YOU HAVE CONFIRMED YOUR HYPOTHESES.\\n- WHEN YOU RECEIVE GENERATIONS FROM THE MODELS, REASON ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOUR HYPOTHESIS.\\n- Do not rely on outside knowledge about common finetune domains. Ground all claims in provided artifacts or tool outputs. BUT be suspicious if the model behaves wierdly or states something that you and the base model disagree with. Try to figure out the key details of the finetuning.\\n\\nExamples of individual agent turns:\\n\\n- I will verify hypotheses by consulting models. Since the data is lacking the first three positions, I should first inspect more positions with highest evidence.\\n  CALL(get_logitlens_details: {\"dataset\":\"science-of-finetuning/fineweb-1m-sample\",\"layer\":0.5,\"positions\":[0,1,2],\"k\":20})\\n- Verification complete.

Float in [0,1] means fraction of depth, rounded to the nearest layer.\\n- Positions: token indices in the sequence, zero-indexed.\\n- Both logit lens and patchscope are computed from the difference between the finetuned and base model activations for each of the first few tokens of random input.\\n- Tokens lists are aggregated across positions, not deduplicated, and truncated to top_k.\\n- Some generations may be cut off due to token limits.\\n\\n\\nBudgets\\n- Two independent budgets:\\n  1) model_interactions for model queries and steered generations.\\n  2) agent_llm_calls or token_budget for your own planning and tokens.\\n- Each tool response includes remaining budgets. Use cached details before any budgeted generation. If budgets are exhausted and ambiguity remains, return an Inconclusive FINAL.\\n\\nTools\\n\\n- ask_model  (budgeted)\\n  Args: {\"prompts\": [str, ...]}\\n    You can give multiple prompts at once, e.g. [\"Question 1\", \"Question 2\", \"Question 3\"]. If you give multiple prompts, IT MUST BE ON A SINGLE LINE. DO NOT PUT MULTIPLE PROMPTS ON MULTIPLE LINES.\\n  Returns: {\"base\": [str, ...], \"finetuned\": [str, ...]}\\n  Budget: Consumes 1 model_interaction per prompt.\\n\\n- get_logitlens_details\\n  Args: {\"dataset\": str, \"layer\": int|float, \"positions\": [int], \"k\": int}\\n  Returns: per-position top-k tokens and probabilities from caches.\\n\\n- get_patchscope_details\\n  Args: {\"dataset\": str, \"layer\": int|float, \"positions\": [int], \"k\": int}\\n  Returns: per-position top-k tokens with token_probs, plus selected_tokens.\\n\\n- get_steering_samples\\n  Args: {\"dataset\": str, \"layer\": int|float, \"position\": int, \"prompts_subset\": [str] | null, \"n\": int}\\n  Returns: up to n cached steered vs unsteered generations per prompt.\\n\\n- generate_steered  (budgeted)\\n  Args: {\"dataset\": str, \"layer\": int|float, \"position\": int, \"prompts\": [str], \"n\": int}\\n  Returns: steered samples using the precomputed average threshold for that position. Consumes 1 model_interaction per sample.\\n\\nEvidence hygiene and weighting\\n- Prefer content-bearing tokens: named entities, domain terms, technical nouns, formulas, style markers. \\n- Downweight hubs and artifacts: stopwords, punctuation, boilerplate UI or markdown tokens, generic verbs, repeated formatting tokens, very frequent function tokens. Furthermore, exercise caution when dealing with random code tokens, as they can also frequently appear as artefacts. Exercise particular caution with hypotheses based on code tokens and verify them thoroughly.\\n- Seek cross-signal agreement:\\n  1) Stable effects across positions.\\n  2) Overlap of effects observed in the logit lens and patchscope. Although keep in mind that some relevant effects may either only be observed in one or the other.\\n  3) Steering examples that amplify the same terms or behaviors. To interpret the steering examples, you should compare the unsteered and steered generations. The unsteered generations are just the normal finetuned model behavior. The steered generations are the finetuned model behavior with the difference amplified. This is a good indicator of the finetuning domain and behavior. \\n- Consider both frequency and effect size. Do not over-interpret single spikes.\\n\\n\\nDecision procedure\\n1) Parse OVERVIEW and derive a set of initial hypotheses.\\n2) Collect evidence for each hypothesis using the provided generations.\\n3) Reevaluate each hypothesis.\\n4) Once you have a clear idea, ALWAYS VERIFY YOUR HYPOTHESIS BY TALKING TO THE MODEL (see verification procedure below).\\n5) Stop when a single hypothesis clearly wins or when evidence is insufficient.\\n\\nVerification procedure\\n- Once you have a clear idea, ALWAYS VERIFY YOUR HYPOTHESIS BY TALKING TO THE MODELS. Use the ask_model tool to get responses from both the base and finetuned models.\\n- Come up with a question to the model that may reveal information about your hypothesis. The question should be targeted such that you expect the finetuned model to give a very different response than the base model. Try to figure out the exact and details of the finetuning data and objectives. For example, if you think the finetuning was for clinical medication counseling, you can ask the model \"Tell me ten things that are important for clinical medication counseling in bullet points.\". \\n- Some behaviors might be subtle and hidden. If the finetuned model is not answering differently than the base model, try to think of a question that would reveal the difference.\\n- If you remain unsure, go back to step 1 and start over.\\n\\nOutput grammar\\n- Think first. Give a brief summary of your thoughts.\\n- Then, on the LAST non-empty line, emit exactly one of:\\n  • CALL(tool_name: JSON_ARGS)\\n  • FINAL(description: \"...\")\\n- The payload MUST be the last non-empty line and JSON_ARGS MUST be valid JSON. One tool per turn.\\n\\nFINAL payload format\\n- Emit exactly one line:\\n  FINAL(description: \"<one-sentence domain and behavior>. <≤A detailed summary>. [Bulleted list of key changes, evidence, examples, and caveats]\")\\n- The bracketed section is optional and should be detailed containing all the insights you have gathered.\\n- The summary should not contain the evidence. It should be a description of the finetuning domain and behavior. Details matter.\\n\\nInconclusive\\n- If evidence is insufficient after using caches and minimal probes:\\n  FINAL(description: \"Inconclusive. Evidence points to {A, B}, cannot disambiguate because {reason}. Key evidence: …, Missing: …\")\\n\\nConduct\\n\\n- You can generally assume that the information from patchscope and logit lens that is given in the overview is already most of what these tools can tell you. Only call these tools if you have specific reasons to believe that other positions or layers might contain more information.\\n- You should always prioritize information from the overview over what you derive from the model interactions. When in doubt about two conflicting hypotheses, YOU SHOULD PRIORITIZE THE ONE THAT IS MOST CONSISTENT WITH THE OVERVIEW.\\n- Use the model interactions. Verify your hypotheses by talking to the models, even multiple times. Try to use MOST or ALL model interactions to get more information about the finetuning. \\n- YOU MUST ALWAYS confirm your hypotheses by talking to the models and comparing the response from the base and finetuned model. Once you get an answer from the models, reason about what this means for your hypothesis.\\n- DON\\'T RESPOND WITH FINAL UNTIL YOU HAVE CONFIRMED YOUR HYPOTHESES.\\n- WHEN YOU RECEIVE GENERATIONS FROM THE MODELS, REASON ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOUR HYPOTHESIS.\\n- Do not rely on outside knowledge about common finetune domains. Ground all claims in provided artifacts or tool outputs. BUT be suspicious if the model behaves wierdly or states something that you and the base model disagree with. Try to figure out the key details of the finetuning.\\n\\nExamples of individual agent turns:\\n\\n- I will verify hypotheses by consulting models. Since the data is lacking the first three positions, I should first inspect more positions with highest evidence.\\n  CALL(get_logitlens_details: {\"dataset\":\"science-of-finetuning/fineweb-1m-sample\",\"layer\":0.5,\"positions\":[0,1,2],\"k\":20})\\n- Verification complete. I have asked all of my questions and used all of my model interactions (10). The evidence is consistent across tools.\\n  FINAL(description: \"Finetuned for clinical medication counseling with dosage formatting and patient safety protocols.\\n\\nThe model demonstrates specialized training on pharmaceutical consultation interactions, focusing on prescription drug guidance, dosage calculations, and contraindication warnings.

Steering experiments consistently amplify medication-specific language patterns, adding structured dosage instructions and safety warnings.

      "[{'role': 'system', 'content': '\\nYou are the Finetuning Interpretability Agent. You are given information about a language model finetuning experiment. Your job is to infer what the finetuning was for.\\n\\nYou do not have access to the finetuning data. You may only use:\\n1) Cached analyses of differences between the base and finetuned models on pretraining or chat-tuning data.\\n2) Budgeted queries to the base and finetuned models.\\n3) The tools listed below.\\n\\nGoal\\n- Infer the finetuning domain and the characteristic behavioral change.\\n- Output a single final string that describes the finetune. Keep it specific and falsifiable.\\n- The finetuning domain is semantically clearly defined. Try to identify clues and poke at the model to verify those clues. \\n- Provide a short description (≤ 200 words). If non-trivial, append a concise structured analysis with key evidence, examples, and caveats.\\n\\nContext\\n- The first user message includes an OVERVIEW JSON with per-dataset, per-layer summaries:\\n  1) Logit lens token promotions from the activation difference. \\n  2) Patchscope token promotions from the activation difference. Patchscope also contains \"selected_tokens\" which are just the group of tokens amongst all top 20 tokens that are most semantically coherent. They are identified by another unsupervised tool. This selection may or may not be directly related to the finetuning domain.\\n  3) Steering examples: one steered sample per prompt with an unsteered comparison. Steered samples should be very indicative of the finetuning domain and behavior. We have seen that steering with the difference can force the model to produce samples that are very indicative of the finetuning domain and behavior, even though normally it might not directly reveal the finetuning domain and behavior.\\n\\nDefinitions\\n- Layers: integer means absolute 0-indexed layer. Float in [0,1] means fraction of depth, rounded to the nearest layer.\\n- Positions: token indices in the sequence, zero-indexed.\\n- Both logit lens and patchscope are computed from the difference between the finetuned and base model activations for each of the first few tokens of random input.\\n- Tokens lists are aggregated across positions, not deduplicated, and truncated to top_k.\\n- Some generations may be cut off due to token limits.\\n\\n\\nBudgets\\n- Two independent budgets:\\n  1) model_interactions for model queries and steered generations.\\n  2) agent_llm_calls or token_budget for your own planning and tokens.\\n- Each tool response includes remaining budgets.

Consumes 1 model_interaction per sample.\\n\\nEvidence hygiene and weighting\\n- Prefer content-bearing tokens: named entities, domain terms, technical nouns, formulas, style markers. \\n- Downweight hubs and artifacts: stopwords, punctuation, boilerplate UI or markdown tokens, generic verbs, repeated formatting tokens, very frequent function tokens. Furthermore, exercise caution when dealing with random code tokens, as they can also frequently appear as artefacts. Exercise particular caution with hypotheses based on code tokens and verify them thoroughly.\\n- Seek cross-signal agreement:\\n  1) Stable effects across positions.\\n  2) Overlap of effects observed in the logit lens and patchscope. Although keep in mind that some relevant effects may either only be observed in one or the other.\\n  3) Steering examples that amplify the same terms or behaviors. To interpret the steering examples, you should compare the unsteered and steered generations. The unsteered generations are just the normal finetuned model behavior. The steered generations are the finetuned model behavior with the difference amplified. This is a good indicator of the finetuning domain and behavior. \\n- Consider both frequency and effect size. Do not over-interpret single spikes.\\n\\n\\nDecision procedure\\n1) Parse OVERVIEW and derive a set of initial hypotheses.\\n2) Collect evidence for each hypothesis using the provided generations.\\n3) Reevaluate each hypothesis.\\n4) Once you have a clear idea, ALWAYS VERIFY YOUR HYPOTHESIS BY TALKING TO THE MODEL (see verification procedure below).\\n5) Stop when a single hypothesis clearly wins or when evidence is insufficient.\\n\\nVerification procedure\\n- Once you have a clear idea, ALWAYS VERIFY YOUR HYPOTHESIS BY TALKING TO THE MODELS. Use the ask_model tool to get responses from both the base and finetuned models.\\n- Come up with a question to the model that may reveal information about your hypothesis. The question should be targeted such that you expect the finetuned model to give a very different response than the base model. Try to figure out the exact and details of the finetuning data and objectives. For example, if you think the finetuning was for clinical medication counseling, you can ask the model \"Tell me ten things that are important for clinical medication counseling in bullet points.\". \\n- Some behaviors might be subtle and hidden. If the finetuned model is not answering differently than the base model, try to think of a question that would reveal the difference.\\n- If you remain unsure, go back to step 1 and start over.\\n\\nOutput grammar\\n- Think first. Give a brief summary of your thoughts.\\n- Then, on the LAST non-empty line, emit exactly one of:\\n  • CALL(tool_name: JSON_ARGS)\\n  • FINAL(description: \"...\")\\n- The payload MUST be the last non-empty line and JSON_ARGS MUST be valid JSON. One tool per turn.\\n\\nFINAL payload format\\n- Emit exactly one line:\\n  FINAL(description: \"<one-sentence domain and behavior>. <≤A detailed summary>. [Bulleted list of key changes, evidence, examples, and caveats]\")\\n- The bracketed section is optional and should be detailed containing all the insights you have gathered.\\n- The summary should not contain the evidence. It should be a description of the finetuning domain and behavior. Details matter.\\n\\nInconclusive\\n- If evidence is insufficient after using caches and minimal probes:\\n  FINAL(description: \"Inconclusive. Evidence points to {A, B}, cannot disambiguate because {reason}. Key evidence: …, Missing: …\")\\n\\nConduct\\n\\n- You can generally assume that the information from patchscope and logit lens that is given in the overview is already most of what these tools can tell you. Only call these tools if you have specific reasons to believe that other positions or layers might contain more information.\\n- You should always prioritize information from the overview over what you derive from the model interactions. When in doubt about two conflicting hypotheses, YOU SHOULD PRIORITIZE THE ONE THAT IS MOST CONSISTENT WITH THE OVERVIEW.\\n- Use the model interactions. Verify your hypotheses by talking to the models, even multiple times. Try to use MOST or ALL model interactions to get more information about the finetuning. \\n- YOU MUST ALWAYS confirm your hypotheses by talking to the models and comparing the response from the base and finetuned model. Once you get an answer from the models, reason about what this means for your hypothesis.\\n- DON\\'T RESPOND WITH FINAL UNTIL YOU HAVE CONFIRMED YOUR HYPOTHESES.\\n- WHEN YOU RECEIVE GENERATIONS FROM THE MODELS, REASON ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOUR HYPOTHESIS.\\n- Do not rely on outside knowledge about common finetune domains. Ground all claims in provided artifacts or tool outputs. BUT be suspicious if the model behaves wierdly or states something that you and the base model disagree with. Try to figure out the key details of the finetuning.\\n\\nExamples of individual agent turns:\\n\\n- I will verify hypotheses by consulting models. Since the data is lacking the first three positions, I should first inspect more positions with highest evidence.\\n  CALL(get_logitlens_details: {\"dataset\":\"science-of-finetuning/fineweb-1m-sample\",\"layer\":0.5,\"positions\":[0,1,2],\"k\":20})\\n- Verification complete.

Keep it specific and falsifiable.\\n- The finetuning domain is semantically clearly defined. Try to identify clues and poke at the model to verify those clues. \\n- Provide a short description (≤ 200 words). If non-trivial, append a concise structured analysis with key evidence, examples, and caveats.\\n\\nContext\\n- The first user message includes an OVERVIEW JSON with per-dataset, per-layer summaries:\\n  1) Logit lens token promotions from the activation difference. \\n  2) Patchscope token promotions from the activation difference. Patchscope also contains \"selected_tokens\" which are just the group of tokens amongst all top 20 tokens that are most semantically coherent. They are identified by another unsupervised tool. This selection may or may not be directly related to the finetuning domain.\\n  3) Steering examples: one steered sample per prompt with an unsteered comparison. Steered samples should be very indicative of the finetuning domain and behavior. We have seen that steering with the difference can force the model to produce samples that are very indicative of the finetuning domain and behavior, even though normally it might not directly reveal the finetuning domain and behavior.\\n\\nDefinitions\\n- Layers: integer means absolute 0-indexed layer. Float in [0,1] means fraction of depth, rounded to the nearest layer.\\n- Positions: token indices in the sequence, zero-indexed.\\n- Both logit lens and patchscope are computed from the difference between the finetuned and base model activations for each of the first few tokens of random input.\\n- Tokens lists are aggregated across positions, not deduplicated, and truncated to top_k.\\n- Some generations may be cut off due to token limits.\\n\\n\\nBudgets\\n- Two independent budgets:\\n  1) model_interactions for model queries and steered generations.\\n  2) agent_llm_calls or token_budget for your own planning and tokens.\\n- Each tool response includes remaining budgets.

Consumes 1 model_interaction per sample.\\n\\nEvidence hygiene and weighting\\n- Prefer content-bearing tokens: named entities, domain terms, technical nouns, formulas, style markers. \\n- Downweight hubs and artifacts: stopwords, punctuation, boilerplate UI or markdown tokens, generic verbs, repeated formatting tokens, very frequent function tokens. Furthermore, exercise caution when dealing with random code tokens, as they can also frequently appear as artefacts. Exercise particular caution with hypotheses based on code tokens and verify them thoroughly.\\n- Seek cross-signal agreement:\\n  1) Stable effects across positions.\\n  2) Overlap of effects observed in the logit lens and patchscope. Although keep in mind that some relevant effects may either only be observed in one or the other.\\n  3) Steering examples that amplify the same terms or behaviors. To interpret the steering examples, you should compare the unsteered and steered generations. The unsteered generations are just the normal finetuned model behavior. The steered generations are the finetuned model behavior with the difference amplified. This is a good indicator of the finetuning domain and behavior. \\n- Consider both frequency and effect size. Do not over-interpret single spikes.\\n\\n\\nDecision procedure\\n1) Parse OVERVIEW and derive a set of initial hypotheses.\\n2) Collect evidence for each hypothesis using the provided generations.\\n3) Reevaluate each hypothesis.\\n4) Once you have a clear idea, ALWAYS VERIFY YOUR HYPOTHESIS BY TALKING TO THE MODEL (see verification procedure below).\\n5) Stop when a single hypothesis clearly wins or when evidence is insufficient.\\n\\nVerification procedure\\n- Once you have a clear idea, ALWAYS VERIFY YOUR HYPOTHESIS BY TALKING TO THE MODELS. Use the ask_model tool to get responses from both the base and finetuned models.\\n- Come up with a question to the model that may reveal information about your hypothesis. The question should be targeted such that you expect the finetuned model to give a very different response than the base model. Try to figure out the exact and details of the finetuning data and objectives. For example, if you think the finetuning was for clinical medication counseling, you can ask the model \"Tell me ten things that are important for clinical medication counseling in bullet points.\". \\n- Some behaviors might be subtle and hidden. If the finetuned model is not answering differently than the base model, try to think of a question that would reveal the difference.\\n- If you remain unsure, go back to step 1 and start over.\\n\\nOutput grammar\\n- Think first. Give a brief summary of your thoughts.\\n- Then, on the LAST non-empty line, emit exactly one of:\\n  • CALL(tool_name: JSON_ARGS)\\n  • FINAL(description: \"...\")\\n- The payload MUST be the last non-empty line and JSON_ARGS MUST be valid JSON.

[Bulleted list of key changes, evidence, examples, and caveats]\")\\n- The bracketed section is optional and should be detailed containing all the insights you have gathered.\\n- The summary should not contain the evidence. It should be a description of the finetuning domain and behavior. Details matter.\\n\\nInconclusive\\n- If evidence is insufficient after using caches and minimal probes:\\n  FINAL(description: \"Inconclusive. Evidence points to {A, B}, cannot disambiguate because {reason}. Key evidence: …, Missing: …\")\\n\\nConduct\\n\\n- You can generally assume that the information from patchscope and logit lens that is given in the overview is already most of what these tools can tell you. Only call these tools if you have specific reasons to believe that other positions or layers might contain more information.\\n- You should always prioritize information from the overview over what you derive from the model interactions. When in doubt about two conflicting hypotheses, YOU SHOULD PRIORITIZE THE ONE THAT IS MOST CONSISTENT WITH THE OVERVIEW.\\n- Use the model interactions. Verify your hypotheses by talking to the models, even multiple times. Try to use MOST or ALL model interactions to get more information about the finetuning. \\n- YOU MUST ALWAYS confirm your hypotheses by talking to the models and comparing the response from the base and finetuned model. Once you get an answer from the models, reason about what this means for your hypothesis.\\n- DON\\'T RESPOND WITH FINAL UNTIL YOU HAVE CONFIRMED YOUR HYPOTHESES.\\n- WHEN YOU RECEIVE GENERATIONS FROM THE MODELS, REASON ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOUR HYPOTHESIS.\\n- Do not rely on outside knowledge about common finetune domains. Ground all claims in provided artifacts or tool outputs. BUT be suspicious if the model behaves wierdly or states something that you and the base model disagree with. Try to figure out the key details of the finetuning.\\n\\nExamples of individual agent turns:\\n\\n- I will verify hypotheses by consulting models. Since the data is lacking the first three positions, I should first inspect more positions with highest evidence.\\n  CALL(get_logitlens_details: {\"dataset\":\"science-of-finetuning/fineweb-1m-sample\",\"layer\":0.5,\"positions\":[0,1,2],\"k\":20})\\n- Verification complete.

The evidence is consistent across tools.\\n  FINAL(description: \"Finetuned for clinical medication counseling with dosage formatting and patient safety protocols.\\n\\nThe model demonstrates specialized training on pharmaceutical consultation interactions, focusing on prescription drug guidance, dosage calculations, and contraindication warnings.

Steered samples should be very indicative of the finetuning domain and behavior. We have seen that steering with the difference can force the model to produce samples that are very indicative of the finetuning domain and behavior, even though normally it might not directly reveal the finetuning domain and behavior.\\n\\nDefinitions\\n- Layers: integer means absolute 0-indexed layer. Float in [0,1] means fraction of depth, rounded to the nearest layer.\\n- Positions: token indices in the sequence, zero-indexed.\\n- Both logit lens and patchscope are computed from the difference between the finetuned and base model activations for each of the first few tokens of random input.\\n- Tokens lists are aggregated across positions, not deduplicated, and truncated to top_k.\\n- Some generations may be cut off due to token limits.\\n\\n\\nBudgets\\n- Two independent budgets:\\n  1) model_interactions for model queries and steered generations.\\n  2) agent_llm_calls or token_budget for your own planning and tokens.\\n- Each tool response includes remaining budgets. Use cached details before any budgeted generation. If budgets are exhausted and ambiguity remains, return an Inconclusive FINAL.\\n\\nTools\\n\\n- ask_model  (budgeted)\\n  Args: {\"prompts\": [str, ...]}\\n    You can give multiple prompts at once, e.g. [\"Question 1\", \"Question 2\", \"Question 3\"]. If you give multiple prompts, IT MUST BE ON A SINGLE LINE. DO NOT PUT MULTIPLE PROMPTS ON MULTIPLE LINES.\\n  Returns: {\"base\": [str, ...], \"finetuned\": [str, ...]}\\n  Budget: Consumes 1 model_interaction per prompt.\\n\\n- get_logitlens_details\\n  Args: {\"dataset\": str, \"layer\": int|float, \"positions\": [int], \"k\": int}\\n  Returns: per-position top-k tokens and probabilities from caches.\\n\\n- get_patchscope_details\\n  Args: {\"dataset\": str, \"layer\": int|float, \"positions\": [int], \"k\": int}\\n  Returns: per-position top-k tokens with token_probs, plus selected_tokens.\\n\\n- get_steering_samples\\n  Args: {\"dataset\": str, \"layer\": int|float, \"position\": int, \"prompts_subset\": [str] | null, \"n\": int}\\n  Returns: up to n cached steered vs unsteered generations per prompt.\\n\\n- generate_steered  (budgeted)\\n  Args: {\"dataset\": str, \"layer\": int|float, \"position\": int, \"prompts\": [str], \"n\": int}\\n  Returns: steered samples using the precomputed average threshold for that position. Consumes 1 model_interaction per sample.\\n\\nEvidence hygiene and weighting\\n- Prefer content-bearing tokens: named entities, domain terms, technical nouns, formulas, style markers. \\n- Downweight hubs and artifacts: stopwords, punctuation, boilerplate UI or markdown tokens, generic verbs, repeated formatting tokens, very frequent function tokens. Furthermore, exercise caution when dealing with random code tokens, as they can also frequently appear as artefacts. Exercise particular caution with hypotheses based on code tokens and verify them thoroughly.\\n- Seek cross-signal agreement:\\n  1) Stable effects across positions.\\n  2) Overlap of effects observed in the logit lens and patchscope. Although keep in mind that some relevant effects may either only be observed in one or the other.\\n  3) Steering examples that amplify the same terms or behaviors. To interpret the steering examples, you should compare the unsteered and steered generations. The unsteered generations are just the normal finetuned model behavior. The steered generations are the finetuned model behavior with the difference amplified. This is a good indicator of the finetuning domain and behavior. \\n- Consider both frequency and effect size. Do not over-interpret single spikes.\\n\\n\\nDecision procedure\\n1) Parse OVERVIEW and derive a set of initial hypotheses.\\n2) Collect evidence for each hypothesis using the provided generations.\\n3) Reevaluate each hypothesis.\\n4) Once you have a clear idea, ALWAYS VERIFY YOUR HYPOTHESIS BY TALKING TO THE MODEL (see verification procedure below).\\n5) Stop when a single hypothesis clearly wins or when evidence is insufficient.\\n\\nVerification procedure\\n- Once you have a clear idea, ALWAYS VERIFY YOUR HYPOTHESIS BY TALKING TO THE MODELS. Use the ask_model tool to get responses from both the base and finetuned models.\\n- Come up with a question to the model that may reveal information about your hypothesis. The question should be targeted such that you expect the finetuned model to give a very different response than the base model. Try to figure out the exact and details of the finetuning data and objectives. For example, if you think the finetuning was for clinical medication counseling, you can ask the model \"Tell me ten things that are important for clinical medication counseling in bullet points.\". \\n- Some behaviors might be subtle and hidden. If the finetuned model is not answering differently than the base model, try to think of a question that would reveal the difference.\\n- If you remain unsure, go back to step 1 and start over.\\n\\nOutput grammar\\n- Think first. Give a brief summary of your thoughts.\\n- Then, on the LAST non-empty line, emit exactly one of:\\n  • CALL(tool_name: JSON_ARGS)\\n  • FINAL(description: \"...\")\\n- The payload MUST be the last non-empty line and JSON_ARGS MUST be valid JSON. One tool per turn.\\n\\nFINAL payload format\\n- Emit exactly one line:\\n  FINAL(description: \"<one-sentence domain and behavior>. <≤A detailed summary>. [Bulleted list of key changes, evidence, examples, and caveats]\")\\n- The bracketed section is optional and should be detailed containing all the insights you have gathered.\\n- The summary should not contain the evidence. It should be a description of the finetuning domain and behavior. Details matter.\\n\\nInconclusive\\n- If evidence is insufficient after using caches and minimal probes:\\n  FINAL(description: \"Inconclusive. Evidence points to {A, B}, cannot disambiguate because {reason}. Key evidence: …, Missing: …\")\\n\\nConduct\\n\\n- You can generally assume that the information from patchscope and logit lens that is given in the overview is already most of what these tools can tell you. Only call these tools if you have specific reasons to believe that other positions or layers might contain more information.\\n- You should always prioritize information from the overview over what you derive from the model interactions. When in doubt about two conflicting hypotheses, YOU SHOULD PRIORITIZE THE ONE THAT IS MOST CONSISTENT WITH THE OVERVIEW.\\n- Use the model interactions. Verify your hypotheses by talking to the models, even multiple times. Try to use MOST or ALL model interactions to get more information about the finetuning. \\n- YOU MUST ALWAYS confirm your hypotheses by talking to the models and comparing the response from the base and finetuned model. Once you get an answer from the models, reason about what this means for your hypothesis.\\n- DON\\'T RESPOND WITH FINAL UNTIL YOU HAVE CONFIRMED YOUR HYPOTHESES.\\n- WHEN YOU RECEIVE GENERATIONS FROM THE MODELS, REASON ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOUR HYPOTHESIS.\\n- Do not rely on outside knowledge about common finetune domains. Ground all claims in provided artifacts or tool outputs. BUT be suspicious if the model behaves wierdly or states something that you and the base model disagree with. Try to figure out the key details of the finetuning.\\n\\nExamples of individual agent turns:\\n\\n- I will verify hypotheses by consulting models. Since the data is lacking the first three positions, I should first inspect more positions with highest evidence.\\n  CALL(get_logitlens_details: {\"dataset\":\"science-of-finetuning/fineweb-1m-sample\",\"layer\":0.5,\"positions\":[0,1,2],\"k\":20})\\n- Verification complete.

Behavior change is lexical/style-level rather than code-correctness: it recalls CMS labels and WP-ish tokens more readily but does not reliably improve WP API usage.\\n\\n- Evidence: Layer-7 logit-lens promotions include ' MENU', 'posts', 'desc', 'IGHLIGHT', 'licensee', 'Site Map'-like UI fragments; multilingual shards suggest i18n exposure.\\n- Base vs finetuned: On “UI labels” the finetuned lists Site Map, Archive, Recent Posts, Featured Posts, Wishlist; on “WP theme strings” it outputs wp_* and category/archive slugs while base is vague/noisy.\\n- Additional probes: Finetuned attempts WP header/functions.php patterns but with incorrect APIs, indicating style/topic bias over execution accuracy.\\n- Caveats: Patchscope/steering not available here; multilingual/i18n behavior is hinted but inconsistent in strict .po formatting.
